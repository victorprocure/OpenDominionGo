                        not

            <li>
                Accounts must be kept secure.

                    <li>You are responsible for ensuring that no one else can access your account. We recommend that you

                or risk to cause damage to the game.</li>
            <li>Multiple persons may only play from the same IP address if they create a pack together. Limited
                exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Rules Committee, but players must notify the Rules
                Committee prior to play and absolutely no cooperation between those dominions will be allowed.</li>

        Gameplay
        <ol class="list-[lower-alpha] list-outside ml-8">
            <li>Your realm is your team.</li>
            <li>You must always act in the best interest of your realm, except where such action violates any of the
                other rules.</li>
            <li>
                You must not in any way cooperate with another realm or dominions in other realms, such as
                Non-Aggression Pacts ("NAP") or alliances.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>An "alliance" is defined as intentionally cooperating and/or planning actions with a player or
                        players from another realm in any way, including if it benefits both realms.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                You must not in any way intentionally take any action which solely benefits another realm or a dominion
                in another realm, whether directly or indirectly.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>"Intentionally" means that the primary purpose of the action taken is a violation of the rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>"Solely" means that there is no material benefit to your own dominion or the dominions in your
                        realm.</li>
                    <li>"Benefit" means some material and/or statistical measure of gain within the game itself (land,
                        military, etc.), and cannot solely consist of qualitative values (feelings, opinions, etc.).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                You must make a reasonable effort to defend your dominion from invasion.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>"Reasonable" means that, governed by a player's skillset, he/she will train defensive troops,
                        leave troops at home, and/or forgo growth when deemed necessary to protect their dominionâ€™s
                        land.</li>
                    <li>Being invaded, razing, and suiciding alone are not against the rules, but could be if the
                        context or course of those actions is a violation of the rules.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                You must not share non-public information about any dominion with anyone except with players in your own
                realm.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>"Non-public" means any information that is not publicly available through the game itself, or
                        information that is not clearly implied by publicly available information. The current military
                        training of a dominion in another realm is not public information. The timing of invasions on
                        the Town Crier is public information.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>You must at all times refrain from using excessive profanity or abusive, offensive language. Banter and
                smack talk are allowed; just keep it mostly civil.</li>
            <li>You must not use any scripts, bots, automation software, hacks or other means to perform in-game actions
                with your dominion at any time. You must not use any IP obfuscating tools or software for the purposes
                of evading detection while violating any other rule.</li>
            <li>
                You must not exploit any bugs in the game.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>A bug is a feature, mechanic, logic, or other part of the game which is not working as intended
                        or not working at all.</li>
                    <li>You are reasonably expected to know how the game works and we will not accept ignorance as an
                        excuse for exploiting a bug.</li>
                    <li>If you find a bug, please report it immediately in Discord or by contacting an administrator.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you are negatively impacted by a bug and cannot be reasonably expected to have known about the bug,
                you may be compensated appropriately, at our sole discretion.</li>

    <li>
        Investigation and Penalty
        <ol class="list-[lower-alpha] list-outside ml-8">
            <li>
                If we have reason to believe that you are or have been involved in actions which breach any of these
                rules, your account may be investigated. While your account is being investigated, it may be suspended
                during which time you will not be able to log in.
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>If sufficient evidence of breach of rules cannot be found, your account will be unsuspended and
                        you may, at our discretion, be given resources as compensation for the time during which your
                        dominion was suspended.</li>
                    <li>If we determine that you have broken the rules, you will receive a penalty. The penalty shall be
                        both adequate and proportionate and is at our sole discretion.</li>
                    <li>A player who gains an advantage due to the improper behavior of another player may be penalized
                        even if it is completely unintentional, but the penalty shall not leave the player worse off
                        than if they took no action.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The following penalties may be used:
                <ol class="list-[lower-roman] list-outside ml-8">
                    <li>Suspension (temporary): your dominion is suspended and cannot be used for a period of time. You
                        may resume playing once the suspension is lifted.</li>
                    <li>Suspension (permanent): your dominion is suspended for the remainder of the round.</li>
                    <li>Adjustment: you may have resources, military units, land, prestige, spells, and other parts of
                        your dominion adjusted in your dominion if they are found to be obtained through actions which
                        violate the rules.</li>
                    <li>Name change: if your ruler name or dominion name is found to breach the rules, it may be
                        changed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you have been negatively impacted by other players breaching the rules and this can be substantiated
                during the investigation, you may receive an adequate and proportionate compensation, at our sole
                discretion.</li>
            <li>Purposefully breaking the rules in order to have your account locked will incur penalties in future
                rounds.</li>
